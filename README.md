# ProjectPolygon

## Code Challenge

Using Unity and C# create a new 2D project and draw a hexagon of any color. When the hexagon is double-clicked or double-tapped, the hexagon should change to a random color. The hexagon should only be clickable/tappable in the bounds of the hexagon. Also, include a menu system that allows you to switch the shape of the element. The example code should work on mobile and desktop devices.

## Optional Challenges

• Make the hexagon/shape animate

• Make a more complex gesture or animation

• Mask an image into the hexagon/shape

• Add some audio effects

• Add some custom shader effects

• Make a small game (programmer art more than acceptable)

• Anything else you would like to show us!
